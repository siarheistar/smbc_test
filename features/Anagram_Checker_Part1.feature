Feature: Anagram Checker - Part 1
  As a user
  I want to check if two strings are anagrams
  So that I can verify their relationship

  Scenario Outline: Check if two strings are anagrams - Set 1
    Given the input strings "<input1>" and "<input2>"
    When I check if they are anagrams
    Then the result should be "<output>"

    Examples:
      | input1            | input2          | output |
      | listen            | silent          | true   |
      | hello             | world           | false  |
      | conversation      | voices rant on  | true   |
      | school master     | the classroom   | true   |
